## Intro
I'm from a small town in northern Pennsylvania, and when I'm able to escape from the house I enjoy taking my dog for a hike or going to the beach! Between my last cohort and now I've been either preparing for certifications or diving deeper into vanilla JS. I'm looking forward to expanding my skills in this upcoming cohort. I edited this in vim and am running arch btw.
